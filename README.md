# Real-time-PUC-Check-Device
This device will check the pollution status of the vehicle on road and raise signals according to the PUC values provided.

This “Real Time automatic PUC check device” project was made on the top of Voice Controlled Car and has a MQ Sensor mounted on it along with a Camera. It works for checking the pollution caused due to a vehicle in real time without trusting the credibility of classic PUC Certificates issued by Pollution check Centers (within 15 minutes in just Rs.50). It would maintain the database of vehicles having composition of exhaust out of bound.
